A mobile robot planner that computes trajectories based on a reward function. The reward function takes into account the requested goal, the static and moving obstacles. The robot predicts the moving obstacles behavior and tries to maximize the reward function, according to probabilities of the next position. The application is tested in the Gazebo simulator. The planner is implemented in Julia, using JuliaPOMDP (https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP). The communication between modules is achieved using the ROS framework.
